## 启用模拟器键盘

you are running this on the iOS simulator? Turn off the host machine's hardware keyboard integration by unchecking Hardware > Keyboard > Connect Hardware Keyboard, or you can use the Keyboard Shortcut: Shift + Cmd + K, and the keyboard will appear when you focus on a TextInput.

You can also manually toggle the software keyboard visibility with Cmd +K.

On a real device the keyboard should work out-of-the-box as expected.
